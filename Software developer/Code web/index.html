            <p>I noticed long ago, that all the websites about computer programming contests work on Web 1.0 principles. But the 21st century has come, the 30th International Programming Contest took place, and Google celebrated its 10th anniversary. Something has to be done! As Software-as-a-Service is conquering the world, contests administrators are still copying tests into judge systems. Something has to be done!
                Codeforces' aim is to offer you a convenient platform to organize, run and discuss programming contests. It will be a bit of a social network website, more than a news portal and more than an online judge. Being absolutely independent from me, you will be able to organize and run a contest. You will decide on your own if to make it open to the whole world or if it will be a contest for your University only. And if you're not interested in this, you might discuss the news in the contest world - read/write blogs, discuss topics, and support your dearest and nearest.
                Moreover, I plan to run regular contests according to new and interesting rules. Closer to the end of February I will be able to run the first beta-contests.
                But it's about the future, and now I suggest to go to Harbin together with the Saratov State University team. I will be writing a blog about our trip. I hope it will be interesting.
                For sure, you will find out, that many important features are missing there. It's because we're still working on it. Be patient, please. I will be glad to read your comments about what and how should be done. I can't promise that I'll be working on the system during the trip, but I'll go on working when we come back.</p>
